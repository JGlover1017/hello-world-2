Starting a new world

JESUS LOVES ME!!!
JESUS LOVES YOU!!!
JESUS DIED FOR ME AND YOU!!!
He did it because we were sinners and were seperated from God.
God sent His only begotten Son to fill in the gap.
God in the flesh came down to save His creation, by dieng like us on a cross.
Jesus Christ, an innocent sacrifice that could truly take our place on the cross.
THANK YOU JESUS!!!
We were made to praise, worship, and glorify our God.
We're not perfect, but by God's Grace, He Loves us anyhow and we can always run to Him with arms open.
That is why He deserves our worship and praise. He did all of this not expecting anything in return.
He did it simply because he loved us!
THANK GOD FOR HIS LOVE!

Lord let me glorify you in all I do, and know that even when I mess up, that it is all for your purpose and will. Thank you Jesus! Let your Holy Spirit guide my fingers Lord!  Amen!
